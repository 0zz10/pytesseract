Python-tesseract is a python wrapper for google tesseract-ocr
( http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ ).  Python-tesseract is also useful
as an invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported
by the Python imaging library, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
Tesseract by default only supports tiff and bmp. Additionally, if used as a
script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text in stead of writing it
to a file.


USAGE:
From the shell:
 $ ./tesseract.py image.jpeg                # prints recognized text in image
 $ ./tesseract.py -l fra french_image.jpeg  # recognizes french text
In python:
 > from tesseract import image_to_string
 > import Image
 > print image_to_string(Image('image.jpeg'))
 > print image_to_string(Image('french_image.jpeg'), lang='fra')


INSTALLATION:
* Python-tesseract requires python2.5 or later.
* You will need the Python Imaging Library (PIL).  Under Debian/Ubuntu, this is
  the package "python-imaging".
* Install tesseract-ocr from http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ . You must
  be able to invoke the tesseract command as "tesseract". If this isn't the
  case, for example because tesseract isn't in your PATH, you will have to
  change the "tesseract_cmd" variable at the top of 'tesseract.py'.
